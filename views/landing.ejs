					<h4>Welcome To Comic Craze</h4>
					<p>
						This is a place where a comic enthusiast can have fun reading and creating new comics. This is a totally non-profit site made because some brat wanted to learn web programming and everyone was telling him to practise by making a project.<br>
						So he decided to make one.
